# Data marks the spot!
A data science project dedicated to analyzing shipwreck data to gain insight into the more common features of these incidents. Prediction of unknown shipwreck locations is in the eventual pipeline, fueling our childhood dreams of treasure seeking! 

## Data sources

There are a variety of different sources from which we can pull shipwreck data. These include, but are not limited to:
1. [Global NASA data, 250k shipwrecks](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1214613883-SCIOPS): where is the data? Contacted the DAAC, no response yet. I think it might now be behind a paywall
2. [US Coastal wrecks, 10k](https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/wrecks-and-obstructions.html): free, easy
3. [Western Australia, 1650](https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/shipwrecks): free, easy
4. [Nova Scotia, 5k](https://novascotia.ca/museum/wrecks/wrecks/): not easy format/no download, inaccurate location data
5. [Northern Maritime Research, 150k](http://www.northernmaritimeresearch.com/index.html): not easy format, should contact for download
6. [UK, 94k](https://datahub.admiralty.co.uk/portal/apps/sites/#/marine-data-portal/items?tags=GlobalWrecks): free, easy
7. [Worldwide, 209k](https://www.wrecksite.ew): pay for data, VPN necessary to access
8. [List of Databases](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/List-of-the-shipwreck-databases-explored_tbl1_355646396)

It's very impressive how many independent cataloguers of shipwrecks there are out there.

This shipwreck data needs to be complemented withadditional sources of data, such as 

#### Topographic / Bathymetry Data

NOAA seems to be common a source of this type of data
1. [Chart of Oceans](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/)
2. [Using Bathymetry & Deep Learning](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/analytics/detecting-shipwrecks-using-deep-learning/)
3. [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/bathymetry/)

#### Weather

#### Port

#### Wartime
