# Data marks the spot!
A data science project dedicated to analyzing shipwreck data to gain insight into the more common features of these incidents. Prediction of unknown shipwreck locations is in the eventual pipeline, fueling our childhood dreams of treasure seeking! 

## Data sources

There are a variety of different sources from which we can pull shipwreck data. These include, but are not limited to:
1. [Global NASA data, 250k shipwrecks](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/concepts/C1214613883-SCIOPS)
2. [US Coastal wrecks, 10k](https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/wrecks-and-obstructions.html)
3. [Western Australia, 1650](https://catalogue.data.wa.gov.au/dataset/shipwrecks)
4. [Nova Scotia, 5k (inaccurate location data)](https://novascotia.ca/museum/wrecks/wrecks/)
5. [Northern Maritime Research, 150k (no data download)](http://www.northernmaritimeresearch.com/index.html)
It's very impressive how many independent cataloguers of shipwrecks there are out there.

This shipwreck data needs to be complemented withadditional sources of data, such as 
#### Topographic

#### Weather

#### Port

#### Wartime
